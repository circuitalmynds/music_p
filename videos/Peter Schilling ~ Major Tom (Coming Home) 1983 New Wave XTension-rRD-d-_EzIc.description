This song pays tribute to David Bowie's "Space Oddity" by name checking Major Tom but Peter Schilling admits he used the name but took his inspiration for the song from a Gregory Peck movie from 1968, "The Stalking Moon" I checked IMDB there is a character named Major but no character named Tom. 

Peter Schilling (n√©e Pierre Michael Schilling) was born in Stuttgart, Germany on January 28, 1956. He loved the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, but when he picked up a guitar he preferred folk music then he got drafted into the army. While there he perfected his guitar playing and then upon his release, began to work for music publishers and had a few of his songs recorded by others and a few he did record himself to no great response.

By 1981 he had become friends with Armin Sabol and the two wrote songs together for his 1983 album, "Error In The System" which contained his only hit "Major Tom (Coming Home)  German Version that was written by Peter with English lyrics by David Lodge. Released in Germany in 1982, it took a full year to catch on in the US where it peaked at #14 on the Hot100.

There was a lot of controversy over the fact that Schilling continued on the story of David Bowie's storytelling but the catchy song did not suffer in sales. Bowie did continue the "Space Oddity" protagonist on his own when he recorded "Ashes To Ashes" in 1980 with these lyrics; "Ashes to ashes, funk to funky. We know Major Tom's a junkies, Strung out in heaven's high, Hitting an all-time low"

Schilling never found another hit to match the magnitude of his lone looper and has not graced the charts since but not for a lack of trying. He experimented with dance music using vocal samples from a German TV science fiction show called "Raumpatrouille Orion" for his entry on the successful Dancemania CD for Japan only. In 2000 he formed a new band that currently plays live shows in Europe.
